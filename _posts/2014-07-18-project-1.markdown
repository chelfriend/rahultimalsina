description: This machine learning project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection. I have looked into different algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, to recognize the most profound predictors. Along the careful analysis and tuning, I achieved a higher accuracy rate, showcasing real-world data challenges and building effective predictive modules. This project is about data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation.
