description: In my Kaggle project on Titanic ML prediction, I applied machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection. I explored various algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, to identify the most accurate predictors. Through careful analysis and tuning, I achieved a high accuracy rate, demonstrating my ability to handle real-world data challenges and build effective predictive models. This project showcases my skills in data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation..
