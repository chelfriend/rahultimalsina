description: In this project, I explored the setup, execution, and debugging of data pipelines using Apache Beam, Google DataFlow, and Apache Flink. I provided setup guides for each framework and implemented a word count pipeline in Python for Beam and DataFlow, and in Java for Flink. Detailed instructions for running the pipelines locally, on the cloud, and on a cluster were included. Additionally, I developed comprehensive guides for debugging and performance tuning. This project highlights my ability to effectively set up, run, and debug data pipelines using these powerful data processing frameworks..
